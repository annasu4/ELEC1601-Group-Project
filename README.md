# ELEC1601-Group-Project
Robot for Line Tracking Competition 

For our final product, we have developed an automated robot that moves in response to  messages sent via Bluetooth from the Arduino. We used ‘w, s, a, d, q, r’ as keys to represent left, right, forwards, backwards, reverse, and stop to control the robot’s position, with each key pressed stored into an array to be accessed for our automated path return. Our robot also contains IR sensors and receivers secured by tape, a breadboard directly under IR sensors both of which aim to maximise detection of obstacles and limiting any unnecessary detection objects e.g. wires on the robot under it.
